# Assignment 4
## Goal
The goal is to write bash and python scripts which together try out the "velveth" assembler on a prokaryotic dataset. (Original article about Velvet and a hands-on guide on how to use it.). You should vary the "kmer" parameter within a reasonable range. Note that there are of course other programs which already use this strategy to "automatically" produce the best assembly, e.g. VelvetOptimiser and KMerGenie.
