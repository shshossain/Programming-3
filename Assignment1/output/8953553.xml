      <abstract>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic and resultant lockdowns have brought unprecedented challenges for Maternal, Sexual and Reproductive Health (MSRH) services. Components of MSRH services adversely affected include antenatal, postnatal, and newborn care; provision of family planning and post-abortion care services; sexual and gender-based violence care and prevention; and care and treatment for sexually transmitted infections including HIV. Resuscitating, remodeling or inventing interventions to restore or maintain these essential services at the community level, as a gateway to higher care, is critical to mitigating short and long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on essential MSRH. We propose a possible framework for community involvement and propose integrating key information, education, and communication of MSRH messages within COVID-19 messages.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first detected in the Chinese Wuhan City in December 2020, and rapidly evolved into a global pandemic by March 2020 [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Countries around the world put in place different measures to curb importing the virus from other countries and to contain in-country transmission. The measures were of different severities across the countries; however, they almost universally affected different aspects of people&#x2019;s lives. One key aspect that the World Health Organization (WHO) encouraged governments to ensure was the continuity of essential health services [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Other countries, such as Zimbabwe, initially imposed a full-scale lockdown on their populations, preventing people from accessing critical health services [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. </p>
      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly evolved over the past two years, with most countries having gone through 3&#x2013;4 waves, driven by different variants of concern, including the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and more recently, the Omicron variant [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As the pandemic has become more protracted than initially anticipated, with the possibility of the continued emergence of further waves, countries have to start thinking about living with the virus for an unforeseeable future, especially as vaccines have provided an important preventive tool, and the clinical disease picture has changed significantly. The disease attributable to the Omicron variant was substantially more attenuated than the Beta and Delta variants. This is partly attributable to a highly transmissible yet less virulent variant, and to the effectiveness of vaccination.</p>
      <p>At the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, the Zimbabwean government introduced lockdown and movement restrictions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, prepare for increased caseload and reduce the adverse health and socioeconomic consequences associated with the further spread of SARS-CoV-2. These measures may have negative impacts on healthcare delivery and access for women and girls [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previous outbreaks such as the Ebola virus disease outbreak in Sierra Leonne and the Democratic Republic of Congo provided valuable insights on the consequences of humanitarian disasters and consequent public health interventions on Maternal, Sexual and Reproductive Health (MSRH) [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The United Nations postulates that women and girls are more likely to suffer from sexual and gender-based violence, and their reproductive rights are likely to remain unmet due to the prioritisation of government expenditure towards the fight against the pandemic [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>A proactive approach is critical to mitigating adverse sequelae on MSRH during the COVID-19 pandemic and remaining on track to achieve Sustainable Development Goal number 3 (SDG3). SDG3 encompasses essential elements of MSRH, which include reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births and ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning by 2030 [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this viewpoint, as the COVID-19 has become protracted and countries are looking at ways of living with the virus, we discuss how community participation can be a valuable complement to mainstream healthcare services in mitigating against the negative consequences of the pandemic on essential MSRH services in Zimbabwean societies. Models that involve communities must be economical, sustainable and robust, given that the majority of rural Zimbabweans are poor and struggled with accessing healthcare services even before the pandemic. Therefore, frameworks that will work even beyond the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic are needed.</p>

      <title>2. Community Participation in Primary Health Care</title>
      <p>Community participation may be a valuable complement to conventional health initiatives. The Alma Ata declaration of 1978 recognised community participation as a critical component for the success of Primary Health Care [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Global health stakeholders now promote community participation as a vital component of a human rights-based approach to health [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A community refers to a group of individuals, families or other networks and social circles that provide support and are often the unit on which health activities are organised and focused. The involvement of communities, use of indigenous resources and reliance on peer support may improve health outcomes. Critical to the success of community involvement is the addressing of the social determinants of health and issues around power and control over decisions regarding community health and behaviour change.</p>

        <title>Communities and Some Critical Maternal, Sexual and Reproductive Health Interventions in Low and Middle-Income Countries</title>
        <p>Communities have been at the centre of success for some MSRH interventions in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). The literature suggests that the empowerment of traditional birth attendants may reduce adverse maternal outcomes in guided contexts, primarily through health promotion and facilitating health facility use [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These findings were noted in settings such as Burundi [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], Sierra Leonne [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Guatemala [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of cluster randomized controlled trials in comparable low-resource settings demonstrated that the training of the traditional birth attendants can lead to reduced maternal and perinatal mortality [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In a feasibility study in Zimbabwe, it was noted that the scope of health promotion activities carried out by traditional birth attendants could be expanded to HIV prevention of mother-to-child transmission services [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Community Art Refill Groups have been instrumental in the continuity of highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) uptake in some communities such as in Thyolo in Malawi, ensuring adherence and continued viral suppression [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In Zimbabwe, the Medecins sans Frontieres implemented this concept successfully in some districts, eventually leading to the incorporation of the concept into the Ministry of Health and Child Care&#x2019;s differentiated models of HIV care [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
        <p>In an integrative review that retrieved studies from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Zambia and others, the community distribution of misoprostol tablets by community health workers led to reduced adverse outcomes from post-partum haemorrhage in these resource-limited countries [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In strategies to increase post-abortion care services in Angola, community nurses can successfully manage miscarriages with misoprostol at the community level, reducing referrals to health facilities [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The empowerment of women&#x2019;s groups has resulted in increased contraceptive uptake in some marginalised communities in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These examples attest to the fact that delivering MSRH services to women at a community level can lead to significantly improved outcomes. Central to success is giving the women a sense of ownership/belonging to these programmes as the intended beneficiaries.</p>

      <title>3. Core Aspects of Maternal, Sexual and Reproductive Health</title>
      <p>The core aspects of MSRH include antenatal, perinatal, postpartum and newborn care, family planning (including infertility services), sexual and gender-based violence care and eliminating unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections including HIV and reproductive tract infections. During unprecedented times such as the COVID-19 pandemic, innovative ways of involving the community in reducing adverse MSRH consequences are critical. Some interventions may not necessarily be novel but need resuscitation or re-modelling in the wake of current challenges. We propose a framework for involving the community in closing gaps and mitigating adverse MSRH outcomes. We envisage that these interventions will be sustainable even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Critical to the success of community participation is adequate information, education and communication (IEC). Therefore, the risk communication and community engagement pillar of the Ministry of Health and Child Care of Zimbabwe that oversees the production and distribution of COVID-19 related IEC material, therefore, is central to success. Indeed, close coordination between the several pillars of the COVID-19 response in the Ministry of Health and Child Care such as surveillance, infection prevention and control, risk communication and community engagement and others is very important.</p>
      <sec id="sec3dot1-ijerph-19-03431">
        <title>3.1. Provision of Family Planning Services and Post-Abortion Care</title>
        <p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates the average national unmet need for contraception in Zimbabwe to be 10.4% and is considerably higher in the 15&#x2013;19 years age group at 12.6% [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. COVID-19 travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions and reprioritisation of expenditure are disrupting access to family planning services for women in the country. Whilst we have no specific estimates for Zimbabwe, global estimates suggest an additional 15 million unintended pregnancies with 28,000 maternal and 168,000 newborn deaths for a 10% drop in contraceptive service coverage [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Likewise, a 10% reduction in access to safe abortions in 1 year could increase unsafe abortions by an additional 3.3 million resulting in an additional one thousand maternal deaths [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
        <p>The most popular methods of family planning used by Zimbabwean women include oral contraceptive pills, the injectable depo medroxyprogesterone acetate and the subdermal implant Jadelle. The uptake of other long-acting reversible contraception methods such as the copper intrauterine devices is low in Zimbabwe, and so is the uptake of permanent methods, which are tubal ligation for females and vasectomy for males. In fact, due to the patriarchal nature of Zimbabwean societies, family planning is usually relegated to women. Therefore, males are rarely involved. With very little support from the government, international development partners usually support the provision of contraceptives in the country. Other partners sometimes carry out community outreaches to encourage the uptake and provision of long-acting reversible contraceptives. Due to the pandemic&#x2019;s requirements for infection prevention and control, these services were halted.</p>
        <p>Gaps exist in access to family planning services, especially in the marginalised communities of Zimbabwe that could suffer disproportionately, owing to COVID-19 containment interventions including the unavailability of transport and closure of health facilities. Local and international partners who regularly support the provision of family planning services may have temporarily shifted attention to COVID-19 control. In <xref rid="ijerph-19-03431-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, we propose some interventions to ensure continued access, especially in marginalised communities.</p>
        <p>Access to safe post-abortion care in time is important for reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with these abortions. Abortions, especially the unsafe ones, conducted under unsterile and dangerous conditions can substantially increase associated adverse outcomes through post-abortal haemorrhage, sepsis and trauma such as that which occurs when penetrating objects are used to terminate pregnancies [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Timely access to post-abortion care allows access to antibiotics where needed, evacuations of the uterus which aid in stopping bleeding and infections and the identification of injuries to other structures such as the bowel. In the context of marginalised areas of Zimbabwe, these services are usually available at district hospitals and mission hospitals, and therefore the population requires public transport to reach these centres. Due to restrictions in transport to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, delays are occurring in the decisions to seek care and reach health facilities once the decision to seek care has been made [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B27-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p>

        <title>3.2. Antenatal and Postnatal Care Services</title>
        <p>Focused antenatal care services were disrupted, resulting in unsatisfactory care and surveillance for pregnant women. Pregnant women are therefore not receiving micronutrient supplements, antenatal HIV testing and treatment services, tetanus toxoid and essential antenatal education. The burden of iron deficiency anaemia in rural communities due to reduced nutrient intake may be higher compared to urban communities [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The World Health Organization emphasized the need for good nutrition during the COVID-19 pandemic to maintain strong immunity, and this is even more important for pregnant women, hence the need to ensure that they have continued access to micronutrient supplements, even in times of adversities. The disruption of intermittent presumptive therapy for malaria may result in an upsurge of malaria in pregnancy, with adverse feto-maternal sequelae.</p>
        <p>There is reduced utilisation of maternity services and a trend towards increased maternal and perinatal mortality [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Closer surveillance of the situation is warranted to reflect the true burden. Meanwhile, mitigating interventions are urgently required. Those involved in the care of newborn babies must find ways of reducing neonatal sepsis and complications and ensuring BCG vaccination for babies born in the community. We propose some possible interventions for the continuity of antenatal and postnatal care services at the community level during the COVID-19 pandemic in <xref rid="ijerph-19-03431-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>.</p>

        <title>3.3. Sexually Transmitted Infections and HIV Care and Treatment Services</title>
        <p>Statistical modelling suggests that a 6-month interruption in the provision of HAART could result in an excess of 500,000 deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa in 4 years, and double the vertical transmission of HIV [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. UNAIDS estimates show that approximately 1.3 million people are living with HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe, 67% of whom are women [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. With effective treatment regimens, many are now falling pregnant, and another substantial proportion falls pregnant without knowledge of their HIV status or seroconvert in pregnancy. Failure to access HIV Care and Treatment services serves to reverse the Prevention-of-Mother-to-Child-Transmission (PMTCT) gains realised over the previous years. Differentiated models to ensure continuity of antiretroviral therapy provision especially for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are required urgently. We make suggestions for ensuring continued access to sexually transmitted infection prevention services and HAART at the community level during the COVID-19 pandemic in <xref rid="ijerph-19-03431-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>

Coupled with the lack of timely access to care, women and girls may suffer from unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections including HIV and prolonged post-traumatic stress disorder. Lack of access to basic MSRH services resulted in a 75% increase in maternal mortality in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone as unintended pregnancies increased during the Ebola outbreak [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

      <p>It is important that community MSRH services do not become a substitute for formal healthcare services. Instead, they can be an important intervention for the identification of complications and challenges that require a timely referral, assessment and interventions at district, mission and other hospitals. In the past, community healthcare workers were very effective at treating simple malaria and referring those with severe malaria to hospitals for admission. Similarly, they can be trained to triage pregnant women and refer pregnancies deemed as high risk to health facilities in good time to avert potential complications.</p>

        <title>4.1. Vaccination for Women of Reproductive Age and Community Health Workers</title>
        <p>Like the rest of the world, Zimbabwe commenced COVID-19 vaccination for the adult population in February 2021 [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. COVID-19 vaccination is one of the best public health interventions for the control of the pandemic. Vaccines reduce incident SARS-CoV-2 infections, reduce disease severity, limit hospitalisations and reduce deaths from COVID-19. As MSRH services are extended into communities, it is critical to make sure that both care providers (community health workers) and their clients, who are mainly women of reproductive age in the context of MSRH, are vaccinated. Unfortunately, there are no clear guidelines for the vaccination of pregnant women in Zimbabwe [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and vaccine hesitancy among WRA is relatively higher compared to the rest of the population. This is because this population has safety concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination, including fears of subfertility, miscarriage, adverse pregnancy outcomes and long-term development of their offspring [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, fighting vaccine hesitancy by appropriately addressing this population&#x2019;s concerns is as important as availing the vaccines. Evidence of the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in this population must be availed and communicated during community outreach programmes [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
        <p>Optimising the uptake of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is important towards propelling countries to high proportions of vaccinated cohorts, reducing the chances of breakthrough infections and the continued emergence of variants of concern [<xref rid="B36-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We, therefore, suggest that the government of Zimbabwe must develop full COVID-19 vaccination guidelines for the population of pregnant women, following the examples that have been set by other bodies such as the WHO, the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RCOG) and the American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ACOG).</p>

        <title>4.2. COVID-19 Information, Education and Communication</title>
        <p>The success of public health interventions critically depends on adequate IEC. The COVID-19 risk communication and community engagement pillars in the various districts must engage with their communities to design appropriate IEC material to distribute within the communities, ideally in local languages. Key MSRH messages can be integrated within COVID-19 IEC material to improve efficiency. Local leaders, including parliamentarians, councillors and traditional leaders play an essential role in educating their communities. They must work closely with healthcare practitioners and educators in their areas to ensure that correct messages reach recipients. It is critical to dispel rumours, myths and misconceptions that can negatively influence key public health interventions such as vaccination. Ideal places for placing IEC material include community boreholes, shops and schools. Prevention of COVID-19 and other communicable diseases remains critical as communities move to provide some MSRH services. If not correctly implemented, well-meant interventions can cultivate disaster. Thus, community kiosks, for example, can end up as hotspots for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.</p>
        <p>The risk communication and community engagement pillar has a central role in communicating COVID-19 vaccination messages, fighting vaccine hesitancy, falsehoods, rumours, myths and misconceptions and boosting vaccine confidence, thereby improving uptake of vaccines.</p>

      <title>5. Critical Issues to Consider for Successful Implementation of Community MSRH Services</title>
      <p>The success of community interventions is dependent on motivation and community participation. Involving communities right from the planning stages of the MSRH interventions and in assessing their own needs and developing strategies to meet those needs can increase intervention ownership and sustainability [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This will also help in determining an appropriate and realistic scope of work that addresses the priority MSRH service gaps in the community. It is important to consider the key community stakeholders around MSRH and this can include traditional birth attendants, religious leaders, and the community at large as this forges concessions and mutual understanding between the community and formal health systems. Non-financial performance-based incentives can be effective at increasing community health workers&#x2019; motivation and performance especially when the incentives promote social recognition. While financial performance-based incentives alone can improve service delivery outcomes, they pose a risk of unincentivized tasks being neglected [<xref rid="B38-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This calls for a joint incentives approach by the organizations that run programs within the communities to avoid this negligence of other programs. This can be achieved if organizations supporting health programs can collaborate in creating a pooled fund for incentives with common incentivized service delivery outcomes such that the recipients of the incentives will not be biased towards programs, they perceive to be more financially rewarding. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruption of the workflow upon which community health workers rely; therefore, resources earmarked for performance-based incentives should be reallocated to cover routine salaries and stipends. For instance, village health workers in Zimbabwe&#x2019;s Chipinge district are relying on the allowances paid through UNICEF for their livelihoods as earnings from farming and other activities were disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak [<xref rid="B40-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Community health workers must receive allowances for their time and commitment. Engaging key local partners and community stakeholders to support these interventions is therefore necessary.</p>
      <p>Continuous education to minimise COVID-19 infection within the communities and among the community health workers who provide MSRH services is critical. Thus, basics of infection prevention and control, including hand-washing ports, alcohol-based sanitisers, facemasks and latex gloves need to be supplied. The provision of personal protective equipment is critical as the community health workers bridge the shortages of health workers which are more pronounced in rural areas [<xref rid="B41-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The success of VHWs and CHWs in managing the expectations of the communities they serve will depend on the type and quality of support from the formal health system and from social networks within the communities. This support can further be compromised by the limited access to facilities because of distance, difficult terrain and lack of funds for transport [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B42-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
      <p>Whilst telemedicine has been shown to be a useful intervention for managing women in obstetrics and gynaecology [<xref rid="B43-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], internet and voice call charges could be a barrier to utilisation. Communities must engage with mobile service providers for subsidised charges or free access as corporate social responsibility. Community MSRH should aim to promote cultural norms of collective responsibility that remove the perception of women&#x2019;s health as the responsibility of the individual. The communities where this shift in norms occurs are more likely to sustain their efforts to improve health and maintain mechanisms such as transport systems compared with those that remain focused on individual responsibility [<xref rid="B37-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Furthermore, inclusion and support of men as equal partners can improve sexual and reproductive health indicators, such as contraception acceptance, safer sexual behaviours, use of reproductive health services and reduction in SRH related morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B45-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-ijerph-19-03431" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
      <p>It is important to develop capacity-building strategies for the communities in relation to MSRH knowledge, skills and abilities. The training contents should be adapted to local needs, using appropriate training methodologies for adult learning with considerations of training material being dispensed in local languages. The trained community cadres will also require additional training, refresher courses and regular supportive supervision which can be provided through the various stakeholders operating in these communities.</p>
      <p>Like any other community health intervention, there is a need for research support to measure the effectiveness of the interventions and evaluate the implementation itself with an aim of learning lessons for national and regional scale-up. Stakeholder collaborations that involve the government, non-governmental organisations and academic institutions will help in developing evidence-based interventions. Findings from such evaluations will also help in making communities appreciate the health benefits of the programs thereby enhancing participation and ownership.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>As health facilities remain operating sub-optimally, innovative ways of ensuring continued access to essential MSRH services at the community level are needed. Active community participation and delivery of services at the community level can reduce the undesirable consequences that stem from a failure to access services. Thus, communities and key stakeholders must work closely together to ensure continuity. However, community interventions must be used as a gateway to the formal health sector, and women requiring medical attention must be urgently referred to, to prevent avoidable morbidity and mortality. The government in the meanwhile must find ways of urgently restoring essential health services in accordance with technical guidance from the WHO. Optimising vaccination for community health workers and women of reproductive age including pregnant women is important for ensuring the safety of these populations, including reduced adverse outcomes from severe COVID-19. The government must therefore finalise guidelines for pregnant women and adequately fight vaccine hesitancy adequately among women of reproductive age.</p>
